  abstract = {Cigarette smoking is known to accelerate decline of pulmonary function; however, the role of other factors is less clear. Characteristics of individuals who experienced rapid decline in forced expiratory volume in 1-sec (FEV1) were examined in 4451 Japanese-American men from the Honolulu Heart Program who were aged 45 to 68 years at baseline (1965--1968) and who produced three acceptable FEV1 measures over a 6-year period. Average annual rates of FEV1 decline were calculated by use of within-person regression and were categorized as rapid (⩾ 60 ml/y), moderate (30 to 59 ml/y) or slow ({$<$} 30 ml/y). Lifestyle and biologic factors were compared by FEV1 decline categories after adjustment for age. A logistic regression model showed that continued smoking during follow-up, cigarette pack-years, wheezing, coronary heart disease, alcohol intake, and reduced subscapular skinfold were significantly associated with rapid FEV1 decline, after adjustment for age, height, cholesterol, an indicator of Japanese diet, and education. When analyses were restricted to continuous smokers, cigarette pack-years, wheezing, and reduced subscapular skinfold were found to be independent predictors. Among never smokers, lower educational attainment was a predictor of rapid FEV1 decline, and the association involving subscapular skinfold approached significance (P {$<$} 0.07). These characteristics may be useful in identifying subgroups of the population who are at increased risk of accelerated decline in pulmonary function and thus would be most likely to benefit from appropriate intervention.},

  abstract = {Bernard Rosner's FUNDAMENTALS OF BIOSTATISTICS is a practical introduction to the methods, techniques, and computation of statistics with human subjects. It prepares students for their future courses and careers by introducing the statistical methods most often used in medical literature. Rosner minimizes the amount of mathematical formulation (algebra-based) while still giving complete explanations of all the important concepts. As in previous editions, a major strength of this book is that every new concept is developed systematically through completely worked out examples from current medical research problems.},

  abstract = {The authors have investigated the effects of parental smoking patterns on the pulmonary function of children in East Boston, Massachusetts. A crude inverse dose-response relationship was observed between the level of FEF25--75\% predicted of children who never smoked and the number of smoking parents in the household. Compared to children with two non-smoking parents, the level of FEF25--75\% predicted was 0.156 and 0.355 standard deviation units lower for children with one and two currently smoking parents, respectively. An additional decline in level of FEF25--75\% predicted was observed for children who themselves had smoked. Smoking children with two smoking parents had an average FEF25--75\% predicted level which was 0.355 standard deviation units lower than non-smoking children with two smoking parents. These data not only confirm that cigarette smoking by young children and teenagers has direct measurable effects on their pulmonary function, but also show that cigarette smoking by parents has a measurable effect on the pulmonary function of their children which is independent of any direct use of cigarettes by the children.},
